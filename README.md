# Gravekeeper: Geo-Mapping-System-using-QGIS (2021)
This system is a project that I developed during my 3rd year in College using Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS Technology) as partial requirement in my school. The primary reason why I developed this project is to support local Muslim people in locating the graves of their loves in the complex Muslim cemetery of Mampang, a local barangay in Zamboanga City.

1. Download and copy the project into the htdoc folder located in the xampp folder.
1. Run xampp, and enable the Apache module as well as the MySQL module.
1. Create the `gravekeeper` database on MySQL, and import the `gravekeeper.sql` file to set the tables up.
